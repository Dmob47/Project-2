🎮 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!  
The computer is secretly thinking of a number between 1 and 100... can you crack the code? 🤔  
Every time you make a guess, the game will guide you:  
  
Too high? 🔼 Try something lower!  
  
Too low? 🔽 Aim a bit higher!     
   
Your mission: guess the number in as few tries as possible.   
The fewer the guesses, the better your score—and if you’re sharp enough, you might just smash the high score record! 🏆
